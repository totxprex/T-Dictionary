# T-Dictionary
A Mini Dictionary Using Free Dictionary API

Has two JS code versions @ index2.js. The first using the Promise, Fetch, AJAX Calls Version, and the second was me experimenting with the older XMLHTTPREQUEST syntax.

Data gotten from the Free Dictionary API.

The CSS loading animation I built can be re-used if you like it :)
